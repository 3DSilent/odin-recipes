# odin-recipes

In this project I'm going to create my first selfmade html website. 
It will consist in a list ot recipes and each one of those will link to it's corresponding page.

The objective of this project is to interiorize all the knowledge I've acquired so far:

- Working from the command line (create directories and navigate them, creating all sorts of files, etc.)
- Using git to update my progress
- Programming using HTML, making use of lists, images, links etc.
